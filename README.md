I am practicing them in the Hacker rank and uploading the code here after the succesfull execution of the problem including all the test Cases. 
I advise you to try on your own before going for the solution here, because you might solve with a different and better approach. 
Also, if you feel your code is better in terms of complexity, please provide here.
